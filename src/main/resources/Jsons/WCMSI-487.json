      "Dropdown1": "What is ASTM International?",
      "Text1": "> Formed in 1898, ASTM International (formerly the American Society for Testing and Materials) is a not-for-profit global leader in the development and delivery of voluntary consensus standards.",
      "Dropdown2": "Who are the members of ASTM International?",

  "Standards": {
    "Header": "Standards",
    "Dropdown1": "What is an ASTM standard? ",
    "Text1": "> A standard is a document that has been developed and established within the consensus principles of ASTMs procedures and regulations. Standards provide information to  manufacturers, laboratories, retailers, and consumers. In ASTM International, the term standard serves as a nominative adjective in the title of documents, such as test methods or specifications, to connote specified consensus and approval. The various types of standard documents are based on the needs and usages as prescribed by the technical committees of the Society.  ",
    "Dropdown2": "Who creates the standards?",
    "Text2": "> More than 30,000 volunteer members from across 150 countries come together to develop, write, and support standards through their service on one or more of our nearly 150 technical committees. ",
    "Dropdown3": "What are the benefits of using standards?",
    "Text3": "> The benefits of standards are many and include aligning best practices, enhancing safety, maintaining uniformity, avoiding duplication of efforts, and building trust. ",
    "Dropdown4": "Why are standards important?",
    "Text4": "> Standards make us feel safer, protect our children, enable products to enter into the marketplace faster, provide consumer confidence, protect the environment and much more. Standards make their mark on almost every product, process, and service, including housing (building codes), food (organic food, sanitary requirements, and can sizes), clothing (sizing and labeling), household appliances (safety, energy consumption, and reliability), customer services (protection of personal information), consumer products (toys, furniture, sports equipment), and much more. ",
    "Dropdown5": "How long does it take to develop an ASTM standard?",
    "Text5": "> This depends on several factors including the length of the document, complexity of the technology, research and testing needs, and marketplace urgency. The average is about 16 months, but new standards have been approved in as little as 9 months. With advanced technology, we try to get new high-quality, relevant standards into the marketplace as quickly as possible.  ",
    "Dropdown6": "What is the process for developing an ASTM standard?",
    "Text6": "> ASTM International standards are developed within one of our nearly 150 technical committees. The work typically begins with an informal task group preparing a draft which can then be forwarded into the balloting process. For a standard to be published as an ASTM International standard, the document must successfully move through and pass ASTMs rigorous consensus requirements. Balloting begins within a subcommittee before moving to the main committee/society/public review where all members have an opportunity to vote. If the consensus requirements at all levels are met, it then moves on to the Committee on Standards (COS) to ensure proper procedures were followed and due process is achieved. ",
    "Dropdown7": "Who governs ASTM Internationalâ€™s standards development procedures?",
    "dropdown7": "Who governs ASTM International",
    "Text7": "> ASTMs governing body is our board of directors, which is elected by the entire membership. The board and its standing committees have established procedures to ensure that standards are developed on a consensus basis, that all dissenting parties receive due process, and that all our standards follow style and format requirements.
